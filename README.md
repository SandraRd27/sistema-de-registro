# 🎁 Secret Friend – Web mini-game

Files you’ll find in this folder:
- `index.html` – UI
- `style.css` – styles (already included)
- `app.js` – game logic (junior-level code)
- `assets/` – images & fonts

## How to play

1. Open `index.html` in any browser (just double-click).
2. Type a name and hit **Add** (or «Enter»).
3. Repeat as many times as you like.
4. Click **Draw friend** to reveal a random name; it auto-removes from the list.
5. When only one name is left, the game shows it and tells you to restart.

## Restart

Reload the page (`F5`) to start over.

## Quick notes

- All text is in Spanish.
